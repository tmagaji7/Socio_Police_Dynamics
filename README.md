# Socio-Police Dynamics

## Overview
This project delves into the critical issue of police-involved fatal shootings in the United States. Leveraging data from **The Washington Post database** and **U.S. Census statistics** on poverty, education, income, and race, the study aims to uncover patterns and disparities that explain the distribution and occurrence of these incidents across various regions.

## Objectives
- Visualize the relationship between poverty and high school graduation rates.
- Create a **choropleth map** to illustrate police killings by state.
- Analyze trends in police killings over time to identify patterns.
- Explore correlations between socio-economic factors (e.g., median income, poverty rates, education) and police-involved fatalities.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Sources**:
  - **The Washington Post**: Fatal police shootings dataset (since 2015, with 2,535 records per file).
  - **U.S. Census**: Data on poverty, education, and income (29,322 rows).
- **Insights & Analysis**:
  - Disparities in police shootings by race.
  - Temporal trends in fatal incidents.
  - Correlations between economic and educational factors.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Choropleth maps, scatter plots, bar plots, and line charts illustrating critical findings.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **pandas** and **numpy** for data manipulation.
  - **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **plotly.express** for visualization.
  - **datetime** for temporal analysis.

## Findings
- States with higher high school completion rates report fewer fatal police encounters.
- Weak correlations exist between poverty/income levels and fatal police shootings.
- Racial disparities remain significant, with Black individuals disproportionately affected.
